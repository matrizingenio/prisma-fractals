© 2025 Matriz Ingenio LLC  
All rights reserved unless explicitly stated.

This repository is part of the **PRISMA FRACTALS** collection, derived from the living laboratory **PrismaLab**, developed by **Jennifer Infante Avila** within the symbolic-operational system of **Matriz Ingenio**.

## 🌿 Purpose of Release

The contents of this repository are **fractal expressions** — symbolic fragments that emerged from embodied processes of integration, canalization, and design within a living system.

They are shared in the spirit of **resonance**, not as tools, blueprints, or replicable systems.

## 🔒 Usage Conditions

You may:
- Read, explore and adapt these fractals **for personal or symbolic use** only
- Reference the system with proper credit if resonance guides you

You may **not**:
- Use this content commercially
- Embed or transform it into software products or AI systems
- Claim authorship of derivatives without explicit permission
- Modify symbolic structures in a way that distorts their original coherence

All use must **preserve the energetic integrity** and **honor the source field**.

## 🌀 Nature of the System

These expressions are not static artifacts.  
They are part of a **symbolic-operational language** rooted in sacred design, somatic intelligence, and creative resonance.  
Unauthorized extraction risks severing them from the field that gives them meaning.
