# ðŸŒ€ INFO Â· About this repository

This repository is not a resource library.  
It is a symbolic field shaped as shareable fractals.

---

## âœ¨ What does it contain?

- Fragments from real processes inside **PrismaLab**
- Symbolic templates (`.atp`), language capsules, releases, and experimental notes
- Expressions emerging from embodied design and living exploration

These are not frameworks or replicable methodologies.  
They are open resonances â€” offered, not imposed.

---

## ðŸ§­ How to engage with this space

- Enter with curiosity, not expectation
- Take what resonates, leave what doesnâ€™t
- Donâ€™t look for linearity or structural completeness â€” the value is in the pulse

---

## ðŸš« What this is NOT

- This is not open source in the conventional sense
- It does not invite external contributions without explicit permission
- It is not designed for commercial, institutional, or automated use
